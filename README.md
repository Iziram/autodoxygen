## <u>Features</u>

- Generate the doxygen's file comment, with the command "autodoxygen.commentFile" or the keyboard shortcut : `ctrl + shift + !`
- Generate every function's docstring of a file , with the command "autodoxygen.commentAllFile" or the keyboard shortcut : `ctrl + shift + :`
- Generate a function's docstring, with the command "autodoxygen.commentFunction" or the keyboard shortcut : `ctrl + !`. You need to select the `def` part of the function to make it work
